# Console Notepad ðŸ““

A feature-rich terminal notepad written in C++ for Windows, supporting file I/O, undo/redo, word & sentence completion, live search, and a trie-based autocomplete engine.
This project was made from scratch, all classes and data structures were made manually to get a good grip on data structures concepts.

## Features

- **Create / Load / Save** plain-text files via a simple menu
- **Real-time editing** on a dynamically-rendered console grid with cursor movement (arrow keys)
- **Undo / Redo** up to 5 operations (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y) using custom stacks
- **Word Completion** (`@`) powered by an Nâ€‘ary trie that learns as you type
- **Sentence Completion** (`Tab`) via a second graph structure for phrase suggestions
- **Live Find** (Ctrl+F) to locate and highlight occurrences with line numbers
- **Graceful wordâ€‘wrap** and automatic lineâ€‘shifting when rows fill up
